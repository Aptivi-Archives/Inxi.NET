    "keywords": "What is Inxi.NET? Inxi.NET is a frontend for Inxi, a hardware information application for Linux systems. It allows you to get system information and hardware information. It was initially bundled with Kernel Simulator as a side project, but we decided to split the methods in it to this library. What is this web page? This webpage is an API documentation for mod developers to be used as reference. It constantly gets updated as we push the updates to the main and servicing versions of this project. If you still intend to use a documentation specific to your preferred version of Inxi.NET, you may refer to the releases page of the project and download the attached <version>-doc.rar file. To get started using the documentation, select API Documentation from the top menu and select a namespace to get a clear overview of the API. Feedback If you wish to leave feedback to us about this API reference website, use the issue tracker of the project. If you wish to contribute to the documentation of the API, go to the project source code and make your improvements there on a draft Pull Request ; we don't support override files that are made by clicking on Improve this doc . Any meaningful contributions are welcome. Copyright (c) 2022 EoflaOE and its companies. All rights reserved."

    "keywords": "Inxi.NET main instance This library has its own main instance class which you can use to let the system run Inxi to grab hardware information and pass it to their appropriate properties. This is the master class of system information. Such operation can be established by making a new object reference to the Inxi class like this: Dim InxiInstance As New Inxi() You can also selectively parse hardware by using this overload: Dim InxiInstance As New Inxi(InxiParseFlags) You can then use this instance to get information about hardware. You can either call InxiInstance.Hardware directly, or make an object reference to it, making you write less. Dim HardwareInfo As HardwareInfo = InxiInstance.Hardware HardwareInfo has sections for each hardware listed on the API documentation."
